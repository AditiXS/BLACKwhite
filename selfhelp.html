"Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley is a dystopian novel set in a futuristic world where technology, consumerism, and genetic engineering have created a rigidly stratified society. The story
follows Bernard Marx, an Alpha caste who questions the conformity and superficiality of his world, and John,a "Savage" raised outside the controlled society who challenges its values and norms.
Huxley's narrative is characterized by its exploration of themes such as social control, individuality, and the pursuit of happiness through pleasure and conformity. The novel's depiction of a world
where happiness is manufactured through drugs, conditioning, and instant gratification offers a provocative critique of modernity and the potential consequences of unchecked technological advancement.
Huxley's ability to blend speculative fiction with social commentary creates a compelling and disturbing portrait of a future where freedom and individuality are sacrificed in the name of stability and efficiency.

"Bird Box" is a chilling and suspenseful horror novel by Josh Malerman that explores the terror of the unseen and the fragility of human sanity. The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world where supernatural creatures 
have driven most of humanity to madness and death. The survivors, including protagonist Malorie, must navigate their dangerous new reality blindfolded to avoid glimpsing the creatures that haunt them. Malerman creates
an atmosphere of relentless tension and claustrophobia as Malorie struggles to protect herself and her children while searching for safety. The novel's unconventional narrative structure, alternating between the present 
and flashbacks to the onset of the apocalypse, heightens the sense of dread and uncertainty. "Bird Box" is a gripping psychological thriller that explores fear, survival instincts, and the lengths people will go to 
protect their loved ones.
